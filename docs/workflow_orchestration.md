# Workflow Orchestration

For the workflow orchestration we provide two frameworks: [Flyte](#flyte) and
[StreamFlow](#streamflow).
Please visit the [Machine Learning Workflow Orchestration
Seminar](https://bernddoser.github.io/ML-workflow-orchestration/) for more information.

## Flyte

[Flyte](https://flyte.org/) is a highly scalable cloud-native workflow orchestration platform on top of containers and Kubernetes.
